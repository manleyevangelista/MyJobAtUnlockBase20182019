# What I Did at UnlockBase (2018–2019): Wrote Tutorials and Produced Videos

## Introduction

In 2017 — as I mentioned in one of my [earlier](https://github.com/manleyevangelista/HuaweiE5573CS-933_SIMUnlock_2017PHCornerGuide) repositories — I published a tutorial on PHCorner showing how to SIM unlock and debrand a Huawei E5573CS-933 pocket WiFi. It got a lot of attention from the community, and sometime in late 2018 — a year later — I received an email from someone at UnlockBase. I’m not sure if it was a staff member or the CEO themselves, but they acknowledged the guide and asked if I’d be interested in working with them.

I accepted the offer, and from December 2018 to December 2019, I worked with UnlockBase — writing technical tutorials and producing video demonstrations to help users unlock their devices.

## My role at UnlockBase

My main responsibility was to write tutorials and produce supplementary videos that demonstrated each process step by step.

Writing the tutorials was straightforward — I typed them directly into the company’s WordPress blog. Someone else from the team would then proofread the content before publishing.

As for the video part, that was mostly on me. I handled pretty much everything — recording both the screen and any live parts, editing the video, and finalizing it. Later on, the CEO asked me to start making custom thumbnails too, just to make the videos more enticing.

I used Adobe Premiere for video editing, and Adobe Photoshop to create or edit elements used within the videos. The thumbnails were also made entirely in Photoshop.

Once both the written and video tutorials were ready, the CEO would review and publish them on the official blog and YouTube channel.

Sadly, like many things, this didn’t last forever. After exactly one year, the CEO announced that everyone was being let go, as the company was being transferred to new management.

But what does my work here prove?

It shows that I don’t just have the technical knowledge — I can actually perform the procedures myself. From writing tutorials to recording and editing videos, I took on multiple roles and delivered working solutions to users.
